# Unscented Kalman Filter

## About
This project implements a PID controller as required by the Udacity's [Self Driving Car Nano-Degree program.](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013)

The input data to the PID controller is the cross-track error (CTE), current vehicle velocity, and current steering angle. The PID controller aims to keep the vehicle at the center of the track at all times by manipulating the steering angle.
Additionally, the throttle (i.e., brake and acceleration) input the car has been manipulated based on the requested steering angle. The underlying aim is to recognize that high steering angles indicate a curve, and therefore, the vehicle must slow down in order to remain on the track. 
Of course, a second PID controller to modulate the throttle inputs would be possible, but has not been implemented yet.


### How it Looks
This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases). Select "EKF/UKF" option.

A sample frame from one of the videos as the vehicle negotiates the circuit inside the simulator is ![shown](https://github.com/RomanoViolet/Udacity-Unscented-Kalman-Filter/blob/master/Results/screenshot.png)
The green trace is the path estimated by the Unscented Kalman Filter.

### Prerequisites
_Ad-verbatim from Udacity's Instructions:_

uWebSocketIO Starter Guide

All of the projects in Term 2 and some in Term 3 involve using an open source package called [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets). This package facilitates the same connection between the simulator and code that was used in the Term 1 Behavioral Cloning Project, but now with C++. The package does this by setting up a web socket server connection from the C++ program to the simulator, which acts as the host. In the project repository there are two scripts for installing uWebSocketIO - one for Linux and the other for macOS.

Note: Only uWebSocketIO branch e94b6e1, which the scripts reference, is compatible with the package installation.
Linux Installation:

From the project repository directory run the script: install-ubuntu.sh


### Structure of the Project
The project is structured as follows:
- Folder "src": Contains the core logic required to build the Unscented Kalman Filter
- Folder "Results": Contains a sample video and a screenshot when testing the Unscented Kalman Filter using the simulator supplied by Udacity.
- `build.sh`: A shell script to build the Unscented Kalman Filter project.
- `install-ubuntu.sh`: A script required for installing dependencies for running the simulator. See the section above on "Prerequisites"
- `runExperiment.sh`: A shell script to run the binary built using `build.sh`, and connects to the Udacity's Term 2 simulator. See the section above "How it Looks".


### Running Unscented Kalman Filter
Execute the `runExperiment.sh` which makes the Unscented Kalman Filter application wait on the Udacity's Term 2 simulator. When running the simulator, choose the option "EKF/UKF".

The Kalman Filter reads in the measurements from a radar and a lidar, and provides the estimated x and y coordinate of the vehicle being tracked after fusing information from both sensors.
In addition, the Kalman Filter application also provided the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in the estimates generated by the Kalman Filter.

### Pending Improvements
- Improvements to the accuracy of the Unscented Kalman Filter are possible, and are welcome.
